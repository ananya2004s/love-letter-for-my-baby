  <h1>To Nik Zavr≈°nik</h1>
  <p>
    We met on a bottle drifting through the digital sea, the Bottled app (best decision I made). I installed it just to make friends. I never imagined the message that would change my life was floating toward me.
  </p>
  <p>
    There you were, the gorgeous stranger who understood gym injuries and sprains all too well. Our first bond was built over shared pain and laughter, and soon‚Ä¶ you became my friend. But friendship was just the start.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a few days, we whispered ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt too soon. It was *right*. Because now, over 80 days later, I keep falling for you more deeply than I ever imagined possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nik, you are a blessing to my heart. Your love is loud, steady, and endlessly comforting. You‚Äôre aging like fine wine, on September 9th, you'll be 29, and somehow, even more breathtaking.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never knew a programmer could write himself so perfectly into the code of my heart.
